About me
======

I am a psychologist by training. I hold a B.Sc. in Psychology from Harbin Normal University (China) and a M.Sc. (Merit) in Neuroimaging for Clinical and Cognitive Neuroscience from the University of Manchester (UK). I submitted my PhD thesis in January 2024 at Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen, and now I am waiting to schedule my PhD defense.

Currently I work as a postdoctoral researcher at AG Tranlsational Imaging of Cortical Microstructure, Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Research (HIH), Tübingen, Germany. My research focus is on the memory storage and retrieval process for somatosensory perception, and the plasticity change after intervention on negative memories.
