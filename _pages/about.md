About me
======

I am a psychologist by training. I hold a B.Sc. in Psychology from Harbin Normal University (China) and a M.Sc. (Merit) in Neuroimaging for Clinical and Cognitive Neuroscience from the University of Manchester (UK). I obtained PhD (Dr.rer.nat) with _Summa cum laude_ in November 2024 at Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen, Germany.

My PhD research focused on structural and functional changes across cortical depth and layers during human somatosensory aging, employing Ultra-High Field 7 Tesla MRI as the primary approach and comparing the findings with mouse models using Two-Photon Calcium imaging and histological analysis.

Currently I work as a postdoctoral researcher at AG Tranlsational Imaging of Cortical Microstructure (Kuehn Lab), Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Research (HIH), Tübingen, Germany. My current research focus is on the memory storage & retrieval process on tactile perception, the mechanisms of body memory enhancement & suppression, and the brain plasticity change after intervention on somatic symptoms.
