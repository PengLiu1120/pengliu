About me
======

I am a psychologist by training. I hold a B.Sc. in Psychology from Harbin Normal University (China) and a M.Sc. (Merit) in Neuroimaging for Clinical and Cognitive Neuroscience from the University of Manchester (UK). I obtained PhD (Dr.rer.nat) with _Summa cum laude_ in November 2024 at Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen, Germany.

Currently I work as a postdoctoral researcher at AG Tranlsational Imaging of Cortical Microstructure, Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Research (HIH), Tübingen, Germany. My research focus is on the memory storage and retrieval process for somatosensory perception, and the plasticity change after intervention on negative memories.
