I’m very excited to share the good news that I have received a three-year fellowship with Hertie Network of Excellence in Clinical Neuroscience, base at the site of Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Research. I will be receiving research fundings from Gemeinnützige Hertie-Stiftung to support my research on age-related brain plasticity changes underlying long-term somato symptoms, and investigate the feasibility of self-intervention in aging group. 
This is a great step forward for me to develop into an independent researcher, and learn from the senior scientists.
