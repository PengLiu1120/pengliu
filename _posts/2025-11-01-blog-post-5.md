I’m very honoured to receive 2025 China Europe Outstanding Young Scientist Award by China-Europe Scientists Forum. 
As a kid, being a ‘scientist’ always sound so far away, yet now I am called a scientist on many occasions.
It is a nice feeling, I must say. And it will for sure encourage me to pursue more in my research field.
