I'm incredibly honoured and excited to share the great news, that I am awarded the Attempto-Preis 2025! 
This prize is awarded to junior scientists for outstanding achievements in the neurosciences - to date some of the awardees are distinguished experts in medicine and biology.
The recognition is for our recently published paper, “Layer-specific changes in sensory cortex across the life span in mice and humans.” at Nature Neuroscience. It truly is a career highlight.
This award should also be shared with my great colleague and co-first author of the paper, Dr. Juliane Doehler, for the fantastic team work and dedication that made this research possible.
Looking forward to what comes next!
