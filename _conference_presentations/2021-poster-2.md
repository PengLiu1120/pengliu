Somatosensory aging in rodents is assumed to be accompanied with an enlargement of receptive fields (RFs) and associated impairments in behavior. In rats, RF sizes are only impaired at the hindpaw but not at the forepaw representation in S1, while in humans, RF sizes have not yet been compared between different age groups. The somatotopic location of imaging voxels' RFs (properly called population RF, pRF) can be estimated with 7T-MRI and probabilistic modeling framework offered by Bayesian pRF modeling. Here we use this technique to compare pRF sizes between younger and older adults in S1 and to describe behavioral phenotypes potentially relevant for age-related pRF changes. 19 younger (10 female, mean age 25 years) and 17 older adults (9 male, mean age 69 years) took part in behavioral tests, 3T- and 7T-MRI measurements. The behavioral tests measured individual levels of hand dexterity(Grooved Pegboard Test, Purdue Pegboard Test and Manual Dexterity Test) and tactile spatial acuity (Two-point Discrimination Task, 2PDT). A 1mm isotropic T1-weighted image was obtained at 3T and used for the recon-all pipeline in Freesurfer. 7T-fMRI data were acquired with a BOLD-EPI sequence (resolution: 1mm isotropic) while tactile stimulation was provided to the five fingertips of right hand sequentially (i.e., D1->D5 or D5->D1 in separate runs) by independently-controlled MR-compatible piezoelectric stimulators at 16 Hz. After preprocessing, Bayesian pRF modeling was performed using the BayespRF Toolbox, following a similar pipeline as Puckett (2019).
