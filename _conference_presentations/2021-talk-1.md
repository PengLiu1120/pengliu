Somatosensory aging in rodents is assumed to be accompanied with an enlargement of receptive fields (RFs) and associated impairments in behaviour. In rats, RF sizes are only impaired at the hindpaw but not at the forepaw representation in S1, while in humans, RF sizes have not yet been compared between different age groups. The somatotopic location of imaging voxels' RFs (population RF, pRF) can be estimated with 7T-MRI and probabilistic modelling framework offered by Bayesian pRF modelling. We use this technique to compare pRF sizes between younger and older adults in S1 and to describe behavioural phenotypes potentially relevant for age-related pRF changes.
